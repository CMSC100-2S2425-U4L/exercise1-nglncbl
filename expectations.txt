In my journey through the course CMSC 100, 
I expect to face challenges, but I also believe I will 
overcome them with the help of my lecture and lab instructors. 
I expect to gain a lot of knowledge and experience from this 
course that will be useful in the future.

Edit by Briones: I agree with your expectations.
